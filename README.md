# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
   
   Answers:

1. Python Basics
What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Key Features of Python:
Readability: Python's syntax is clear and easy to understand.
Versatility: Used for web development, data science, automation, and more.
Libraries and Frameworks: Extensive standard library and third-party modules (e.g., Django, Flask, Pandas, NumPy).
Community Support: Large, active community.

Examples of Use Cases:
Web Development: Using frameworks like Django or Flask.
Data Science: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn.
Automation: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
Game Development: Libraries like Pygame.


2. Installing Python
Steps to Install Python:
Download Python: Visit the official Python website and download the installer for your OS.
Run Installer: Follow the instructions to install Python. Ensure you check the option to add Python to your PATH.
Verify Installation: Open a terminal/command prompt and type python --version or python3 --version to verify the installation.
Setting Up a Virtual Environment:

Install venv Module: Included by default in Python 3.3 and later.
Create Virtual Environment: In the terminal, navigate to your project directory and run python -m venv venv.
Activate Virtual Environment:
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate


3. Python Syntax and Semantics
Hello, World! Program:
print("Hello, World!")
Explanation:

print: A built-in function to output text to the console.
"Hello, World!": A string literal.


4. Data Types and Variables
Basic Data Types:
int: Integer, e.g., 42
float: Floating-point number, e.g., 3.14
str: String, e.g., "Hello"
bool: Boolean, e.g., True or False
Script Demonstrating Variables:

# Integer
a = 10
print(a)

# Float
b = 3.14
print(b)

# String
c = "Hello"
print(c)

# Boolean
d = True
print(d)


5. Control Structures
Conditional Statements:
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")

For Loop:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)


6. Functions in Python
What are Functions?
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help to organize and modularize code.

Function Example:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add(3, 5)
print(result)



7. Lists and Dictionaries
Lists:
Ordered, mutable collections of items.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[0])  # Accessing elements
numbers.append(6)  # Adding elements
print(numbers)

Dictionaries:
Unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs.

person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person["name"])  # Accessing values
person["city"] = "New York"  # Adding elements
print(person)



8. Exception Handling
What is Exception Handling?
Managing errors gracefully using try, except, and finally blocks.

Example:
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("This block executes no matter what.")



9. Modules and Packages
Modules and Packages:

Module: A file containing Python code.
Package: A directory containing multiple modules.

Importing a Module:

import math
print(math.sqrt(16))



10. File I/O
Reading from a File:

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a File:

lines = ["Hello", "World"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
